# anime-image-development

###### Introduction – 
In this project we are trying to create a model using Generative Adversarial Networks which would be able to help in the image development of new anime images based on the training it receives. Our project is broadly classified into 3 parts – 
* Image Creation – creation of 32x32 sized images out of random noise.
* Super Resolution – enhancing the resolution of the image by 4 times to get the picture in 128x128 format.
